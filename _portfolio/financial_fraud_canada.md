## Overview

This project investigates over 328,000 financial fraud complaints reported in Canada between 2021 and 2025. The goal is to **analyze victim demographics, fraud categories, and reporting patterns**, and build predictive models to help flag potential fraud.

---

## Objectives

- Detect common and costly fraud types  
- Identify regional and demographic fraud patterns  
- Predict loss outcome using machine learning  
- Deliver insights for awareness and prevention

## Key Insights

- Investment scams caused the largest financial losses  
- Ontario, Quebec, and BC had the most fraud cases  
- Age group 30‚Äì69 was most affected  
- Reporting increased steadily year over year
