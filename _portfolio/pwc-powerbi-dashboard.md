### Project Overview

As part of the PwC Switzerland Job Simulation on Forage, I completed an end-to-end HR analytics project focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). I analyzed employee demographics and KPIs, then visualized insights using an interactive Power BI dashboard tailored for senior leadership.

### Key Contributions

- Cleaned and transformed raw data using Power Query in Power BI.
- Created calculated measures (DAX)
- Built a multi-page interactive dashboard with slicers, trend charts, and KPIs.
- Designed visual storytelling tailored to executive-level stakeholders.

### Outcome

The final dashboard provided clear, data-driven insights into gender representation across roles and departments, supporting evidence-based decision-making for HR initiatives.

### Skills & Tools
