## Overview

This project explores the operational characteristics and geographic distribution of **wind turbines across the United States**, using real-world data from the [CORGIS dataset project](https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/wind_turbines/). The goal is to **analyze trends, uncover insights, and present interactive visualizations** to support sustainability and energy policy discussions.

## Objectives

- Clean, transform, and analyze wind turbine data using `Pandas`
- Explore patterns in turbine capacity, location, and commissioning dates
- Visualize insights using `Bokeh` for an interactive user experience
- Highlight regional trends in renewable energy adoption

## Skills & Tools Applied

| Category | Tools/Skills |
|---------|--------------|
| Data Analysis | Python, Pandas, NumPy |
| Data Cleaning | Handling missing values, feature selection |
| Visualization | Bokeh (interactive plots, filters, hover tools) |
| Data Interpretation | Aggregation, grouping, regional comparison |
| Communication | Insight presentation, storytelling through data |
---

## Key Insights

- **Growth over time**: Significant increase in wind turbine installations post-2010
- **Top States**: Texas, Iowa, and California lead in capacity and turbine count
- **Technology trend**: Newer turbines show higher rated capacity and larger hub heights
- **Sustainability potential**: The dataset highlights areas for renewable energy growth
