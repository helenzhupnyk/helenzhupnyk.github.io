In this collaborative project, I led exploratory data analysis and forecasting for the stock prices of the top 5 Canadian banks: **RBC, TD, CIBC, BMO, and Scotiabank**. The goal was to analyze historical trends, evaluate market volatility, and build predictive models to support **investment decision-making**.

## What we did:
- **Extracted** and cleaned historical stock data from Yahoo Finance using Python and SQL  
- **Stored** the data in a **PostgreSQL** database for efficient querying and analysis  
- Built **interactive Power BI dashboards** to visualize stock trends, volumes, and correlations  
- Applied **Monte Carlo simulations** to model future price distributions  
- Trained **ARIMA models** to forecast future stock performance  
- Interpreted statistical results to provide practical **investment recommendations**

## Key Skills Highlighted:
- **Data engineering**: ETL pipelines, PostgreSQL integration  
- **Visualization & storytelling** using Power BI and Matplotlib  
- **Team collaboration**, version control with GitHub, and task planning  
- **Analytical thinking**: turning raw stock data into actionable financial insights
