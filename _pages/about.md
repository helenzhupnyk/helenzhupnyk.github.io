## About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m **Mariia-Olena Zhupnyk** â€” a junior data scientist with a passion for turning data into actionable insights. My current focus includes data analysis, exploratory data visualization, and building data-driven tools to support smarter business decisions. I enjoy finding meaningful patterns in messy datasets and transforming them into clear, strategic insights.

Iâ€™m currently a **Data Science Intern at M2M Tech**, where Iâ€™m gaining real-world experience solving practical AI and data challenges. Iâ€™ve worked on tasks such as exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation â€” all while collaborating in a team-based environment. I **participated in a WIL project** supporting data exploration and model development for a real-world AI use case. I contributed to internal discussions, task tracking, and learned project scoping practices.

I hold a **Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science** and have worked across multiple domains â€” including **data analytics**, **customer service**, and **website administration**. This blend gives me a unique perspective on both technical problem-solving and user-centered thinking.

I havenâ€™t always worked with data. My early career focused on content management and digital marketing, where I developed strong communication skills and a passion for technology. As I gained more exposure to technical tools, I pivoted fully into analytics â€” building my Python, SQL, and visualization skills through self-study, bootcamps, and hands-on projects.

Outside of work, I enjoy exploring data challenges like building dashboards, analyzing public datasets, and creating visual stories.
